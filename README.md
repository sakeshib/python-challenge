# python-challenge

This week I worked on week 3 challenge assignment on python.

## Location of Files

There's two folders for PyBank and PyPoll. You can find the respective python code in the PyBank/PyPoll folders. The csv files are in the Resources folder and the text files are in the Analysis folder. 

## Resources

I used the Xpert Learning Assistant and tutoring sessions for help on the assignment. For PyBank, I had help (from a TA in office hours) with storing the first row variable in order for my changes in profit and loss formulas to run and capture all the changes throughout the period.
